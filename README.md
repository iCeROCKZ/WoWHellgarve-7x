 - Register your own Github account for free to report your issue(s).
 - Use the search engine to find out if a similar problem has been already reported. If so, check if it's already been fixed and waits for update.
 - Make sure, that what you report is actually a bug.
 - Enclose links to things related to the bug using http://wowhead.com (please note: The XP relates issues are not completely reliable because there have been many changes in the game between Cataclysm-4.3.4 and the current version what wowhead uses).
 - You can use screenshot/video clip from ingame to visual the issue and for better understanding the problem.
 - Use our ISSUE_TEMPLATE when you creating a new report (otherwise it would be invalid).
